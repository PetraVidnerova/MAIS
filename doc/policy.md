# POLICY

## Custom policy 

This policy is typically used as a main policy. It enables you to modify various parameters and run subpolicies, i.e. it can be configured to control and do various things.

|key|value|
|--|--|
|filename|customised_policy|
|name|CustomPolicy| 

Example of config:
```
[POLICY_SETUP]
layer_changes_filename = ../config/policy_params/wasabi.csv
#policy_calendar_filename = ../config/policy_params/sim_cr.json
beta_factor_filename = ../config/policy_params/beta_factor.csv
face_masks_filename = ../config/policy_params/masks.csv
#theta_filename = ../config/policy_params/tety.csv
#test_rate_filename = ../config/policy_params/test_new2.csv
#init_filename = ../config/policy_params/init_october.json
reduction_coef1 = 0.25
reduction_coef2 = 0.75
new_beta = Yes
sub_policies = self_isolation, contact_tracing
self_isolation_filename = wee_cold_sim
self_isolation_name = WeeColdPolicy
contact_tracing_filename = contact_tracing
contact_tracing_name = CRLikePolicy
```

The setup enables you to provide various calendars to control model parameters ([POLICY_SETUP](inifile.md#policy-setup)). Also you define which subpolicies should be run. They can be either included in `policy_calendar` or, if they should run the whole time, specified as `sub_policies`.  


## Self-isolation 

```
self_isolation_filename = wee_cold_sim 
self_isolation_name = WeeColdPolicy
```

If a node starts to exhibit symptoms (enters state I_s), this policy puts it with a certain probability into isolation. 

Config:

#### SELFISOLATION

|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|threshold|number|0.5|probability of staying at home after symptoms exhibit|
|duration|number|7|the minimum length of isolation|


## Testing 

```
testing_filename = testing_policy  
testing_isolation_name = TestingPolicy
```

If a node starts to exhibit symptoms, it decides with a probability `test_rate` to go for test. If yes, each day after it goes 
for the test with a probability `theta_Is` until it is tested or recovered. If tested possitively, node is isolated. 

Config:

#### ISOLATION

|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|duration|number|10|the minimum length of isolation|


## Contact tracing 

```
contact_tracing_filename = contact_tracing 
contact_tracing_name = ContactTracingPolicy
```


It inherits the behaviour of testing policy plus it simulated contact tracing. 

Config:

#### ISOLATION 

|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|duration|number|10|the minimum length of isolation|

#### QUARANTINE 

|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|duration|number|14|the minimum length of quarantine|

#### CONTACT_TRACING

|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|riskiness|comma separated|1.0,0.8,0.4,0.0|probabilites of collectiong contacts on different groups of layers (family, school and work, leisure, other)|
|days_back|number|7|trace 2 days before symptoms or days_back if no symptoms| 
|phone_call_delay|number|2|delay before contact is informed| 
|enter_test_delay|number|5|days between phone call and enter test| 
|enter_test|string|Yes|Yes/No, perform the enter test or not|
|auto_recover|string|No|Yes/No, if No, no test on leaving isolation/quarantine| 



## Vaccination 

```
vaccination_filename = vaccination 
vaccination_name = Vaccination
```


Policy responsible for simulation of vaccination.

Config:

#### CALENDAR
|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|calendar_filename|string|None|file with vaccination calendar (numbers of vaccinated for every day)|
|delay|number|None|number of days between the two doses| 

#### EFFECT
|key|type|default|meaning|
|--|--|--|--|
|first_shot|number|0|0.1|
|second_shot|number|0|0.1|
